Lecture: Problem-Solving Part I
Exploring: 
  (1) Understanding the Problem 
  (2) Test Cases
Next Lecture:
  (3) How to Solve It
 
(1) Understanding the Problem
  1. Input/Output
  - never go by examples
  - take notes for explicit requirements
  - create computational model for implicit requirements
  - if done completely, you should know EXACTLY how to go from input to output from your notes here. If not, you're either missing something (ask the interview) or you need to make something implicit explicit.

(3) Know the building blocks of your language:
  - memorize all methods for Strings, Arrays, Hashes, Enumerables, Integers
