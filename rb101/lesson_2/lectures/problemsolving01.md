Lecture: Problem-Solving Part I
Exploring: 
  (1) Understanding the Problem 
  (2) Test Cases
Next Lecture:
  (3) How to Solve It
 
(1) Understanding the Problem
  1. Input/Output
  - never go by examples
  - take notes for explicit requirements
  - create computational model for implicit requirements
  - once input/output done, jump forward to writing out examples or test cases
  2. Test Cases/ Examples
  - figure out happy path examples
  - look at: edge cases
